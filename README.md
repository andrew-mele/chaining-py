# chaining-py

"""for this assignment from boot camp, I created classes and methods using python. 
When using methods, I attached new method calls to the end of the previous one.
This is called Chaining. In order for this to work, each method must return self. 
By returning self, if we recall how functions work, each method call will now be equal to the instance that called it."""
